              We are seeking volunteers to help bring Belmont's first
              mini-forest to life by planting hundreds of native plants. If
              youâ€™d like to be part of this transformative project, please fill
              out this sign-up form to express your interest in volunteering.
              The forest will need stewards and volunteers to plant seedlings,
              spread mulch, and organize materials. All ages able to participate
              in planting are encouraged to join!
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              After the planting, for the next three growing seasons, volunteers
              will maintain and monitor the forest. This including weeding,
              litter removal and data collection. More information on how to get
              involved with post-planting will be released later!

                        A Miyawaki Forest is a dense planting of native trees
                        and shrubs using Dr. Miyawaki's methods to recreate old
                        growth forests. By amending the soil and planting the
                        seedlings closely together in an area the size of a
                        small swimming pool, the forest grows in a third of the
                        usual time.

                      <p>
                        The native trees create an ecosystem that accelerates
                        the plants' growth and provides a biodiverse habitat for
                        native pollinators.

                        are formed from tall trees, which are the primary trees,
                        and beneath them, semi-tall trees, short trees, and
                        bottom weeds, with the entire forest functioning as a
                        whole system. They are resistant to natural disasters,
                        and do not collapse easily... In addition to such local
                        functions, globally, they absorb carbon and can be
                        expected to curb global warming by solidifying the
                        carbon and maintaining it within the forest for
                        countless years. Naturally, live trees die after several
                        hundred years. But the semi-tall trees and short trees
                        underneath them have successor trees in waiting. When
                        one tree dies, these successor trees quickly dominate
                        the space it left behind. As a result, forest systems
                        sustain themselves semi permanently."

                          10 AM to 6 PM at the Triangle in front of Belmont High
                          School by Clay Pit Pond, 221 Concord Ave.

                          We are seeking volunteers to help bring Belmont's
                          first mini-forest to life by planting hundreds of
                          native plants. If youâ€™d like to be part of this
                          transformative project, please fill out this sign-up
                          form to express your interest in volunteering. All
                          ages able to participate in planting are encouraged to
                          join!
                          <br></br>
                          <br></br>
                          The forest will need stewards and volunteers to plant
                          seedlings, spread mulch, and organize materials.
                          <br></br>
                          <br></br>
                          After the planting, for the next three growing
                          seasons, volunteers will maintain and monitor the
                          forest. This including weeding, litter removal and
                          data collection. More information on how to get
                          involved with post-planting will be released later!

                          forest established on the Belmont Highschool (BHS)
                          campus. My belief is that the Miyawaki forest project
                          will not only further enhance biodiversity at BHS, but
                          will continue to educate students and community
                          members about the benefits and beauty of creating
                          habitats for native plants and creatures, and
                          offsetting the impact of the constructed environment
                          such as runoff. The forest will also be a valuable
                          educational resource for the school. There are clear
                          benefits for a science and engineering curriculum,
                          which are enhanced by opportunities to observe and
                          collect data from the natural world. But beyond that,
                          the space can be used for mindfulness, creative
                          inspiration, and reflection. My support for this
                          program is unequivocal..."<br></br>

                          Miyawaki forest will grow faster than traditional
                          plantings, creating a dense micro forest in just a few
                          years. Native trees and shrubs will increase the
                          diversity of Belmont's canopy (in keeping with a 2023
                          recommendation from the town tree inventory report!)
                          and will support local wildlife. It's a wonderful
                          opportunity to engage students townwide, as well as
                          the community at large. Generations of Belmont
                          residents will benefit from the forest for years to
