# 🌲 Miyawaki Forests Belmont

**Growing Native Forests, One Tree at a Time**

Welcome to Miyawaki Forests Belmont! We are a community-driven environmental action group dedicated to creating dense, native forest ecosystems using the revolutionary Miyawaki method. Our mission is to bring the power of nature back to our local community through fast-growing, biodiverse forests that will benefit generations to come.

## 🌿 What We Do

### Our Mission

Transform vacant lots and underutilized spaces into thriving native forest ecosystems that:

- **Capture carbon** and fight climate change
- **Support biodiversity** with native plants and wildlife habitats
- **Improve air quality** and reduce pollution
- **Create community spaces** for education and connection
- **Build environmental awareness** through hands-on involvement

### The Miyawaki Method

Developed by Japanese botanist Dr. Akira Miyawaki, this innovative approach to forest restoration creates forests that:

- **Grow 10x faster** than conventional tree planting
- **Become 30x denser** with rich biodiversity
- **Require no maintenance** after 2-3 years
- **Self-sustain** as complete ecosystems
- **Use only native species** perfectly adapted to our local environment

## 🎯 Current Project: 3,000 sq ft Community Forest

We're working to plant our first Miyawaki forest in Belmont - a 3,000 square foot demonstration site that will serve as:

- **Living classroom** for students and community members
- **Research site** to study native ecosystem development
- **Community gathering space** for environmental education
- **Model project** to inspire similar efforts throughout the region

### Project Timeline

- **✅ Spring 2025:** Planning and site selection completed
- **✅ Summer 2025:** Native species research and community outreach
- **🔄 Fall 2025:** Community planting event (TARGET DATE)
- **📅 2026-2028:** Growth monitoring and educational programs

## 🌱 Why Miyawaki Forests Matter

> _"In a traditional forest, there might be 10 to 15 species per hectare. In a Miyawaki forest, there can be 100 to 150 species."_ - Dr. Akira Miyawaki

### The Science

- **Native species only:** Plants that naturally belong in our local ecosystem
- **Multi-layer planting:** Shrubs, understory, canopy, and emergent layers
- **Dense planting:** 3-5 trees per square meter vs. conventional spacing
- **Natural competition:** Trees grow faster reaching for sunlight
- **Mycorrhizal networks:** Underground fungal connections support forest health

### Global Impact

- **3,000+ Miyawaki forests** created worldwide
- **300+ cities** using this method for urban reforestation
- **100+ million trees** planted using Miyawaki techniques
- **Proven success** in diverse climates and conditions

## 💚 Join the Movement

**Together, we can transform our community one tree at a time.**

The climate crisis requires bold action, and Miyawaki forests represent one of the most effective, science-based solutions available. By creating these dense, biodiverse ecosystems, we're not just planting trees - we're building resilient communities, cleaner air, and a sustainable future for our children.

**Every tree counts. Every volunteer matters. Every donation helps.**
